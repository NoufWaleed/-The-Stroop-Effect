# The-Stroop-Effect

Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect

I choose Red wine to analysis.
This data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

Guiding Question: 
Which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines?

## Getting Started

you should have math, seaborn, numpy and pandas.

The file formatted to contain: 
1- Background Information.
2- Questions For Investigation.
3- A final section called “Reflection”

The HTML is easier to read.
